I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning (UT Austin). Previously, I was a research fellow at The Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing.  
I received my PhD from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, advised by Jonathan Kelner and Ronitt Rubinfeld. 

Before starting the PhD program, I completed my undergraduate studies at MIT with a major in Computer Science and a double minor in Physics and Philosophy. Earlier, I lived in Yerevan, Armenia, where I primarily competed in contests like the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO).

My scientific research interests include:
* Computational learning theory
* Computational statistics
* Distribution learning and testing

See [_this blog post_](https://www.let-all.com/blog/2025/07/21/testing-assumptions-of-learning-algorithms/), if you want to know more about some of my recent work.
